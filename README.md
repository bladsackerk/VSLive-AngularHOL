# VSLive-AngularHOL

Visual Studio Live! Hands-on Labs for Angular. Note that this repo is designed to be used in conjunction with the VisualStudio Live! workshop, and the authors cannot answer any questions about the material outside of that environment.

This README file contains the default Angular CLI-generated content, plus the lab instructions for each step. Each lab step is tagged with a branch, so to start on the first lab, simply "git checkout lab-1", examine the README file for the instructions, and begin. All instructions will be at the end of the README, so that developers can see what has gone before, and have this file as a reference point for reference purposes.
